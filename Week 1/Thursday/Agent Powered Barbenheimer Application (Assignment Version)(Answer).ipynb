Development began in April 2014, when Sony Pictures acquired the film rights. Following multiple writer and director changes and the casting of Amy Schumer and later Anne Hathaway as Barbie, the rights were transferred to Warner Bros. Pictures in October 2018.

Movie, as well as the highest-grossing film directed solely by a woman and the 20th highest-grossing film of all time.\\n\\n\\n== Plot ==\\nStereotypical Barbie (\"Barbie\") and fellow dolls reside in Barbieland; a matriarchal society with different variations of Barbies, Kens, and a group of discontinued models, who are treated like outcasts due to their unconventional traits. While the Kens spend their days playing at the beach, considering it as their profession, the Barbies hold prestigious jobs such as doctors, lawyers, and politicians. Beach Ken (\"Ken\") is only happy when he is with Barbie and seeks a closer relationship, but Barbie rebuffs him in favor of other activities and female friendships.\\nOne evening at a dance party, Barbie is suddenly stricken with worries about mortality. Overnight, she develops bad breath, cellulite, and flat feet, disrupting her usual routines the next day. Weird Barbie, an outcast due to her disfigurement, tells her she must find the child playing with her in the real world to cure her afflictions. Ken stows away in her convertible hoping to join her on the journey, to which Barbie reluctantly agrees.\\nArriving at Venice Beach, Barbie punches a man for groping her, leading to her and Ken\\'s brief arrest. Alarmed by their presence, Mattel\\'s CEO orders their recapture. Barbie tracks down her owner, a tween girl named Sasha, who criticizes her for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards. Distraught, Barbie discovers that Gloria, a Mattel employee and Sasha\\'s mother, inadvertently catalyzed her existential crisis after Gloria began playing with Sasha\\'s old Barbie toys in a similar state. Mattel attempts to put Barbie in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with Gloria and Sasha\\'s help and the three travel to Barbieland with Mattel executives in pursuit.\\nMeanwhile, Ken learns about the patriarchal system and feels respected for the first time. Returning to Barbieland, he persuades the other Kens to take over, and the Barbies are indoctrinated into submissive roles, such as agreeable girlfriends, housewives, and maids. Barbie arrives and unsuccessfully tries to convince Ken and the Barbies to return to the way things were.

From 2012 onwards, Mattel expanded the franchise beyond just the films to other audiovisual media such as web series, television shows and streaming television content, with the latter following the growing trend of streaming services and online platforms. In 2020, Mattel revamped the films into streaming television films, branding them as animated \"specials\" and integrating them into the canon of the inaugural television show in the Barbie media franchise, Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures. Additionally, a live-action adaptation of the toyline was theatrically released on 21 July 2023 by Warner Bros. and Mattel Films, alongside LuckyChap Entertainment and Heyday Films.\\n\\n\\n== Adaptations and original plots (2001–2009) ==\\nMattel launched its eponymous in-house entertainment division in 2001 and began the Barbie film series by adapting pre-existing stories/tales, with CGI animation provided by Canadian studio Mainframe Entertainment. Elise Allen introduced original storylines to the series through screenwriting the main entries of the Barbie: Fairytopia franchise. In between their co-productions, American studio Curious Pictures pitched in by animating The Barbie Diaries (2006).\\nIn 2007, Mainframe was purchased by the Rainmaker Income Fund, subsequently rebranding as Rainmaker Entertainment the following year. The films were originally distributed on VHS and DVD by Artisan Entertainment and Family Home Entertainment from 2001 until 2004, when both were acquired by and folded into Lionsgate. In 2006, Mattel ceased distribution of the films on VHS and focused solely on DVD; at the same time, Universal (which had already held foreign distribution rights) took over the domestic distribution rights, after negotiations with Lionsgate broke down over the low amount offered by Mattel to continue distributing future Barbie films. Lionsgate was permitted to continue distribution of the titles released by them up to The Barbie Diaries for several years after; these rights eventually reverted to Mattel, who then authorized Universal to begin reissuing these titles.\\n\\n\\n=== Barbie in the Nutcracker (2001) ===\\nBased on The Nutcracker and the Mouse King by E. T. A. Hoffmann and The Nutcracker ballet music by Pyotr Illych Tchaikovsky, this inaugural film in the series stars Barbie narrating a story to her younger sister, Kelly, a story about a young girl named Clara who gets a beautiful wooden nutcracker from her aunt Elizabeth as a Christmas gift. Later that night, the toy comes alive to protect Clara from the evil Mouse King\\'s soldiers. Clara gets shrunk to toy size and along with her brave Nutcracker goes in search of a magical Sugarplum Princess to reverse a spell. In the midst of the adventure is the live nutcracker toy dancing with Clara at two intervals in the film.\\n\\n\\n=== Barbie as Rapunzel (2002) ===\\nThis 2nd entry based on the classic tale by the Brothers Grimm stars Barbie as Rapunzel, who is trapped in a tall tower by an evil witch. Hidden from the outside world, Rapunzel spends much of her day painting and dreaming of a happier life. After many years alone Rapunzel goes on a journey with her friends Penelope and Hobie to find her happily ever after.

It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I\\'m a crotchety old man, I\\'m a woman in my 20s, so I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m this movie\\'s target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid\\'s movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv' metadata={}\n"

Robert Oppenheimer studies under experimental physicist Patrick Blackett at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. He is homesick and suffers from anxiety while struggling with the required lab work.\\nOppenheimer, upset with the demanding Blackett, leaves him a poison-laced apple but retrieves it from the hands of visiting scientist Niels Bohr, who is impressed enough by his intellect to recommend that he should instead study theoretical physics in Germany, where Oppenheimer completes his PhD. He later meets theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg at a conference in Switzerland.\\nOppenheimer returns to the United States, wanting to expand quantum physics research there. He begins teaching at the University of California, Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology, starting with one student. He meets his future wife, Katherine \"Kitty\" Puening, a biologist and ex-communist, and also has an intermittent affair with Jean Tatlock, a member of the Communist Party USA.\\nIn 1938, Nazi Germany\\'s progress in nuclear fission research spurs Oppenheimer and his colleagues to replicate their results. In 1942, amid World War II, U.S. Army General Leslie Groves recruits Oppenheimer to lead the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb after he gives assurances that he has no communist sympathies.\\nOppenheimer, who is Jewish, is particularly driven by the Nazis\\' potentially completing their nuclear weapons program, headed by Heisenberg.

It was released on July 21, 2023, the same day as the film\\'s theatrical release in the United States.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nOn October 8, 2021, Universal Pictures announced production on Oppenheimer and confirmed that composer Ludwig Göransson would be scoring the film. Göransson had previously worked with director Christopher Nolan, scoring Nolan\\'s 2020 film Tenet.Göransson\\'s score was featured in a trailer for the film on  May 8, 2023. It was also featured in the Universal Pictures exclusive five-minute Opening Look on July 13.\\n\\n\\n== Composition ==\\n\\n\\n=== Development ===\\nWhen approached to score Oppenheimer, Göransson was initially intimidated by the scope and magnitude of the project. In the film\\'s early stages of production, Nolan shared the script with his visual effects supervisor Andrew Jackson as he needed to convey phenomena such as quantum mechanics and nuclear reactions onscreen. The visual effects team began creating experimental footage of particles, waves, and chain reactions. Nolan then showed this footage to Göransson, who used it to draw inspiration for his score.Scoring Oppenheimer proved to be a unique challenge for Göransson as he had never composed a soundtrack that only represented one character\\'s inner workings and point of view. Nolan did not give specific direction on how he wanted the score to sound; the only suggestion he gave Göransson was to represent J. Robert Oppenheimer\\'s character and the film\\'s main theme with the violin. Nolan explained, \"There\\'s a tension to the sound in a way that I think fits the highly-strung intellect and emotion of Robert Oppenheimer very well.\" Using the violin as a starting point, Göransson and his wife Serena, a violinist, began experimenting with vibratos and microtonal glissandos; they aimed to convey the anxiety of Oppenheimer through the violin\\'s ability to instantly switch from a romantic and sentimental sound to something \"neurotic\" and \"horrifying.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Production ===\\nGöransson\\'s score comprises three overarching movements: Oppenheimer\\'s background in physics, the Manhattan Project and the Trinity test, and the Atomic Energy Commission hearing. The score begins with lush melodies by strings, harps, and piano as Oppenheimer explores theory and begins his career as a physicist. As the score transitions into the second movement, however, the tone shifts as the atomic bomb is being built, with the increased stakes being amplified by thumping bass and metallic ticking sounds. Göransson was careful not to veer his score toward sounding \"booming,\" especially in the film\\'s second act, as he believed that if the score was too explosive, the detonations in the film wouldn\\'t have as much of an impact on the audience.\\nBefore [the second act], it\\'s just theories, it\\'s just scribble-downs, it\\'s just ideas. But then when there\\'s an actual physical bomb, you take a crazy big tonal shift and just channel that with those synths, with the impending doom. You have that thumping bass and then there\\'s this metallic ticking sound, and that ode is up until the bomb goes off, and then you have these moments of silence, which I think is very effective.\\nWhile the film is a period piece and Göransson did use instrumentation that fit with the times, he also wanted the score to feel \"timeless,\" choosing to infuse the traditional orchestra with synthesizers and mono-production. He and Nolan also chose not to include drums in the score at the risk of it feeling militaristic, instead incorporating percussive elements such as foot stomping, ticking, and dosimeter static. During the nuclear reactor sequence, Göransson had the cellists play col legno, striking the strings with the stick of their bow to create a percussive sound.In addition to its instrumentation, Göransson conveyed the energy of the score through tempo.
